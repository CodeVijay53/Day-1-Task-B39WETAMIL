Hello Mentor,

1. Difference between HTTP1.1 and HTTP2:

I found major breakthrough in developing HTTP2 was performance optimization and also following differences.
a) The HTTP2 work faster when compared to HTTP1.1 where the data transfer speed has been increased tremendously.
b) The HTTP2 uses the method of multiplexing where the user can retrieve more information from the server rather HTTP1.1 will retreive one information at a time.
b) The HTTP2 has the faster parsing period and it is having network delays.

2.Objects in Javascripts:

An object is a reference data type. Where it doesnot store any values, They have a array which has stored the values. In other words it is said as unordered collection of related data of primitive data types.
